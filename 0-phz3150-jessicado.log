Completing homework for this week.

Problem 1: 
1a. Th3 b4ckp4ck un21pp3d 1tself.
1b. Itself zipped bacpack. 
1c. A main feature of a "natural" language that prevents it from 
being a programming langauge would be the use of context. Programming 
langauages are straightforward and clear; natural languages require
interprentation. 

Problem 2: I had already uploaded my hw1 folder to origin last week.
